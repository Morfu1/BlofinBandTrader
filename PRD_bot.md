# Implementing a Trading Strategy Using Blofin Demo Account and Python

## Introduction

This documentation guides users through the process of using a Blofin Demo account to implement a trading strategy in a Python-based bot. The strategy involves using SMA 21 and EMA 34 bands to determine entry points. Positions are opened on the first candle after the price closes outside the bands, with configurable take-profit and stop-loss levels based on the band's position.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing the strategy, ensure the following steps are completed:

 **Configure the Trading Bot**:
   - **Timeframe**: Configurable by the user (e.g., 5m, 15m,1h, 4h, 1D).
   - **Position Size**: Configurable, with a default of 100 USD margin.
   - **Leverage**: Configurable, with a default of 3x.
   - **Position Type**: Configurable, with a default of isolated.
   - **Coin Selection**: Choose the trading pair (e.g., XRP-USDT).
   - **Risk Management**: Configure risk management parameters (e.g., TP, SL).

## Implementation

### Strategy Overview

The strategy involves the following steps:
1. Calculate SMA 21 and EMA 34 bands.
2. Monitor for price closures outside these bands.
3. Open a position on the next candle's opening after the price closes outside the band. Do not open a position later, only at the next candle's opening!!!
4. Set take-profit at the configured percentage and stop-loss just below the lower band for short positions and just above the upper band for long positions.

### Calculating SMA 21 and EMA 34 Bands

To calculate the SMA and EMA bands, fetch historical OHLC data using the Blofin API. Use websockets to receive real-time updates so that se do not miss any real price movements.


### Monitoring Price Closures Outside the Bands

Monitor real-time data for price closures outside the bands using Websocket connections for efficient data retrieval.


### Opening Positions on the Next Candle's Opening

Use scheduling libraries or server time synchronization to open positions precisely at the opening of the next candle.


### Setting Take-Profit and Stop-Loss Levels

For short positions, set the stop-loss above the band (highest wick of the last 10 candles). For long positions, set the stop-loss below the band (lowest wick of the last 10 candles). The take-profit is set at a configurable percentage from the entry point.


### Position Sizing

The position size is configurable, with a default of 100 USD margin. The contract size is adjusted to ensure the position size matches the specified margin amount.
So based on the margin size, leverage, contract size and the current price we calculate the position size and we ensure it is in the limit of the configuredmargin size.


## Conclusion

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to implementing a trading strategy using SMA 21 and EMA 34 bands with a Blofin Demo account and Python. The strategy involves opening positions based on price closures outside the bands and setting configurable take-profit and stop-loss levels. By following this guide, users can successfully implement and test the strategy using the provided code examples and resources.
